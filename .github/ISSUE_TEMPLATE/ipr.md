## 1. Summary
<!--
Provide a few paragraphs summarising the IPR including a summary of the context, problem, and constraints. This should allow someone familiar with the space to understand what the decision is about.
-->

## 2. Context
<!--
Describe why you are solving the problem and what the problem is.

This is usually where you talk about the particular project and value being added as well as describe any current systems that are relevant. Defining goals in measurable terms will greatly aid future review of the IPR outcome.

As you consult various interested parties include any insights gained. It might benefit those reading to note when the conversation occurred, who was present, and what was discussed. If any options are no starters, then briefly describe these (rather than cluttering the options section with non-genuine options).

Provide references to any related documents.

## 3. Constraints

## 4. Assumptions

## 5. Risks

## 6. Out of Scope

## 7. Plan / Options

Preferred option(s): ???
<!-- Indicate the preferred option or options, if applicable. This is not to pre-suppose the outcome of the IPR. Rather, this should indicate to readers of this issue the preferred/anticipated/expected options. --> 

<!--
Outline a number of available options and provide an assessment of the relevant trade-offs.

This is traditionally provided as a list of pros and cons but can take any format that works.

Note that you might be conducting an IPR to endorse a particular plan or approach - i.e. validating one path forward rather than choosing between options. In this case you would outline research that has led to this point.  The constraints etc section would also support that choice.
